**This repo is to make your assessment of my work as seamless as possible.**

**cd run/ then run scripts to quickly test the code**

**Not turning up to lectures while paying for a degree is indeed a big-headed thing to do; this module and its report has changed me more than many things in my life. My apologies for not turning up; I will be attending all lectures from now on.**

**the q3/q3 directory structure is a stylistic choice, emphasising the severity of what this report as taught me**
